          <h3>Who did this?</h3>
          <p>Paper Volleyball was developed solely by some guy who loves two things: volleyball and coding.</p>

          <h3>How was it done?</h3>
          <p>I used C# and Unity to build this game. All of the player sprites and CPU logic were written and designed by myself. It took 1,000 hours to learn all this, including starting the business to sell the game.</p>
